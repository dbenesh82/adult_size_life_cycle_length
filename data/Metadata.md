These four data files are from published datasets. I refer those interested to the papers.

Details on the helminth life cycle database (CLC_database_hosts.csv and CLC_database_lifehistory.csv) can be found [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.1680/suppinfo).

The trophic level of definitive hosts is in the file 'TV_dryad.csv' and is from [Benesh et al. 2014](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1793/20141462).

Finally, the host mass data is compiled from several sources, including [Pantheria]().
